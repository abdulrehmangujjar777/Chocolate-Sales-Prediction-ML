# Chocolate-Sales-Prediction-ML
An end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict chocolate sales using Random Forest Regression. Developed as part of the Developers Hub Internship.
# 🍫 Chocolate Sales Prediction Model

## 📑 Project Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning project developed for the **Developers Hub Online Internship**. The project focuses on predicting sales amounts based on historical data using regression techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed raw sales data, handling currency symbols and type conversions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted temporal features (Month/Year) from date records.
- **Analysis:** Performed Correlation Analysis to understand key sales drivers.
- **Machine Learning:** Built and optimized a **Random Forest Regressor** model.
- **Persistence:** Saved the final model using Pickle for deployment readiness.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
